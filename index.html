      <p>Hello, welcome to my first web page.</p>
      <p>
        Currently I am enrolled on a Level 4 Software Development
        Apprenticeship, and decided to create a web page about myself and my
        engineering career so far to practice my learnings. You know the saying
        practice makes
        <em>perfect.</em>

          I recently changes careers to become a Software Enginer. Something
          which I always had a interest in but never had any opportunties for
          whilst study at school and college.
        </p>
        <p>
          I made the brave decision to apply for a bootcamp for people who had
          no prior experience in software engineering which would teach the
          basics enough to gain a entry level role in a company.
        </p>

          Fast forward to nearly two years later and I know can proudly
          (sometimes can't believe it) say I work at the BBC in Voice + AI
          creating the BBC's first Voice Assitance called <strong>Beeb</strong>.

          I love wakling and getting in the outdoors. My picture is actually

        <h2>Favourite Foods</h2>
        <p>
          I am a big foodie I love a range of cuisines (<strong>except</strong>)
          Sushi. However recently I have just found out I am allergic to cereals
          containing gluten which has a big impact on what I can,
          <em>not a lot</em> and can not eat. Below are my five favourite
          cuisines ordered 1 - 5 before Coeliac diagnosis.

        <ol>
          <li>Chinese</li>
          <li>American</li>
          <li>Turkish</li>
          <li>Indian</li>
